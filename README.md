### Development of Chillin' Demo

Big files like PNG, MP3, MP4, TIF, are not being tracked but their META files are.

For Third parties Assets, get their respective packages. For local Assets, get their respective locally.

Before rolling back to check for errors, have a copy of the "current version assets" and a copy of the "previous assets".
When rolling back, replace assets with the copy of the "previous assets", check where the errors is, and then roll back to the current version, replace assets with current version assets and then you can start working on the error. Never work on the error in previous branches since the assets when merging are not going to be the same.

For the future, I need to find something more relaible for storing all the assets, including big ones.

## So I finished the game and this is the summary

For next projects, I will be only be storing the scripts for version control on github since that's what I personally find it the most helpful
But! I will store everything on my computer using git to be able3 to rollback the same way that I would on github, just on my own computer.
That is the most cost effective and efficient way to do version control for myself alone. (Especially since I got so many games to go!)


Chillin was a super good journey overall, learn mostly about ambiance and how to make the character flow through a game.
Leaned about terrain, lighting, and more stuff that I personally dont want to focus on but I need to know enough to work with other people.
I am not really proud with the product since I had a way more ambition vision for this game but it makes no sense on my place to focus
so much on a game where I am not going to make money, when I am activilty looking to get hired.

Later on, I will come back to this project, probably from scratch and really make something really beautiful.
