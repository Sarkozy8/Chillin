# Chillin

Chillin is a cozy, heartwarming experience set deep in the woods, where the only goal is... to simply chill.

Live a quiet life close to nature as the seasons gently change around you. In winter, venture out to quietly look for wild deer. In spring, tend to your small garden. In summer, cast your line and fish at the lake.

There are no timers. No pressure. No enemies. Just time, space, and stillness.

I made Chillin with the objective of making a game that would warm your heart and offer a gentle escape from the noise of everyday life.
